Abstract
Summary: Hydrogen deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) has emerged as a powerful technique for interrogating the conformational dynamics of proteins and their complexes. Currently, analysis of HDX-MS data remains a laborious procedure, mainly due to the lack of streamlined software to process the large datasets. We present Deuteros which is a standalone soft-ware designed to be coupled with Waters DynamX HDX data analysis software, allowing the rapid analysis and visualization of data from differential HDX-MS. 
Availability: Deuteros is open-source and can be downloaded from https://github.com/andymlau/Deuteros, under the Apache 2.0 license.
Implementation: written in MATLAB and supported on both Windows and MacOS. Requires the MATLAB runtime library.
